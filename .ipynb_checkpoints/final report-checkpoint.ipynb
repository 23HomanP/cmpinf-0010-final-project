Out of these neighborhoods, North Oakland had 455 arrests, South Oakland had 354 arrests, Central Oakland had 521 arrests, and West Oakland had 325 arrests. Shadyside had 971 arrests. Cranberry and McCandless were not included in the data set. Oakland ranked in the mid 40s, and Shadyside ranked 76. I think when choosing a neighborhood, one must factor in more data sets (>3) to make a well-rounded decision. Ultimately living somewhere and getting experience is the best way to find out whether you like to live somewhere or not.\n",
