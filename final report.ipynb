    "Our analysis focused on identifying the neighborhood that excelled across three key metrics: the lowest number of arrests, the fewest illegal dumping sites, and the highest sidewalk-to-street 'walkability' ratio. We believe that these metrics are the most important factors in identifying the healthiest, safest, and most enjoyable neighborhood to live in. Each team member analyzed a specific data set and ranked neighborhoods accordingly. We then used a straightforward average calculation to rank all of the neighborhoods which enabled us to pinpoint the best neighborhood."
